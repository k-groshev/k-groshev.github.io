Hi there!

I am Konstantin, and I am java team leader. I started in 2003 as an R&D engineer and have combined software development and scientific research. This road led me to the PhD in Computer Engineering in 2009. At that point, I've been managing a small team of software engineers that were adopting R&D solutions for the heavy metal industry. A little bit later, in 2011, I changed my technology stack to be on the bleeding edge of the progress and started as a senior java developer.

Since 2014 I worked as a head of a development department and managed three different teams via agile methodology for the large sport-stuff company. After two years of graceful and productive growth, time of changes came again, and in late 2016 I changed the employer in order to be productive in a new area.  

Since I am a technologycal geek, my resume and cv are building by CI from scratch. Current versions of these files you can find in English ([resume][cv-en-short] and [cv][cv-en-full]) 
<!-- and in Russian ([resume][cv-ru-short] and [cv][cv-ru-full])
-->. And of course, you can find me via [linkedIn][cv-linkedin].
