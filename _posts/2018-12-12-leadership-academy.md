This year I studied leadership in a Leadership Academy course by Luxoft Training centre. Seven months went smoothly and quickly, and some days ago I passed the final exam and got a certificate.

My journey to the leadership theory started roughly seven months ago. It was like, you know when you are doing something every day for a long time and then begin a study about how to do it properly. I used to be a team leader for the last 7+ years but never attend such courses. It took 120 hours of classes and much more with homework and self-studies. I'd say it was not a lazy time for me.

Well, first of all, I was excited! For me, it was an excellent opportunity to refine my knowledge and take a look back to processes and decisions made in the past. For sure, I am not disappointed! I've got structured my knowledge, refine my vocabulary and got familiar with a lot of theories and best practices. Some of them were given during the classes, and some were found while digging into the particular area.

Another profit - I've met a lot of interesting people (from Luxoft and the outside): another teams leaders, managers and trainers. What a pleasure to work with people like yourself to gain experience! Speaking about the background, the most valuable experience - is the one based on your own mistakes. So we made a lot of them, and I appreciate the passion and the wisdom of our tutor. She gave us an excellent opportunity to gain the values on our own. That was great! 

Now, when the exam is passed and the classes are over, I have not only the certificate, I have new friends, new tools and techniques, but the most important - I have a theoretical base for my own experience, gained in the past. Now I realise what things were done correctly, what decisions were made in the right way and what processes might be improved. 

What's next? We'll see, but for sure it will be something. It looks as if studying is my hobby.
