Hi there!

I am Konstantin, and I am a PM, Ph.D. I started in 2003 as an R&D engineer and have combined software development and scientific research. This road led me to the PhD in Computer Engineering in 2009. At that point, I've been managing a small team of software engineers that were adopting R&D solutions for the heavy metal industry. A little bit later, in 2011, I changed my technology stack to be on the bleeding edge of the progress and started as a senior java developer.

Since 2014 I worked as a head of a development department in e-comerce and managed three different teams via agile methodology for the large sport-stuff company. After two years of graceful and productive growth, time of changes came again, and in late 2016 I changed the employer in order to be productive in a new area of automotive business sector.

Starting with 2016, I help different teams to make great products for automotive business sector. From zero to hero, starting with requirements management, going though the SoW/WBS/plans/team setup to day-to-day management and leadership with verification and validation. 

Since I am a technologycal geek, my resume and cv are building by CI from scratch. Current versions of these files you can find in English ([resume][cv-en-short-master] and [cv][cv-en-full-master]) 
<!-- and in Russian ([resume][cv-ru-short] and [cv][cv-ru-full])
-->. And of course, you can find me via [linkedIn][cv-linkedin].
